# ReneWInd
"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. In this project, i build various classification models, tune them and find the best one that will help identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators can be reduced.

### About Me
I'm Seyi, and there’s absolutely nothing I love more than using data driven strategies for problem-solving in businesses! 

 I’m a skilled Data scientist and analyst passionate about transforming, exploring and extracting useful and actionable insights from data,creating compelling visuals and reports, and bringing the data to life through storytelling that will inspire the change that needs to happen for businesses to maximize their success.

Using Python, I explore data and perform statistical analysis such as A/B testing, and create machine learning models using supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, depending on the problems to be solved.

I’m proficient in using Python, SQL (intermediate), Microsoft excel, Microsoft power BI and Tableau. I never stop improving on my existing skills, while i'm picking up more skills that are useful
